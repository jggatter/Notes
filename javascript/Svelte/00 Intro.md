# What is Svelte?
#javascript #svelte #frameworks

Svelte is a tool for building web apps.

Like other user interface frameworks,
it allows us to build our app _declaratively_
out of components that combine markup, styles, and behaviors.

These components are _compiled_ into small, effective JavaScript modules
that elminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.

We can build an entire app with Svelte,
for example using an application framework like SvelteKit,
or we can add it incrementally to an existing codebase.
We can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.
