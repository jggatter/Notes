# AWS SageMaker

#aws #sagemaker #python #ml

CellPainting models for imaging datasets?
Pretrained models and inhouse models?

## Saturn cloud

notebooks
model training
attach dask cluster
saturn jobs
environment management (great): image selection and resizing of instances, etc.
customer support is A+
UI is good
Python for ML, R for processing/visualizations

SageMaker can pull in ML models from HuggingFace or Bedrock.

CPU-only interactive notebooks with GPU batch jobs maybe best use case for AWS Batch or maybe SageMaker

AWS wants to know if there are any model we want to use that may or may not be accessible from sagemaker
Autodoc deepdoc?
