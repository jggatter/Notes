# CSS Outline
#css #outline #border #width #color #offset

The outline is a line drawn outside of the element's border.
It can be used to make the element stand out more.

The `outline-style` and shorthand properties are essentially the same
as the `border-` properties. See [[06 Borders]].

Outline style must be specified to use optional properties for width or color.
`outline-offset` adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element.
