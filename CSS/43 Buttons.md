# CSS Buttons
#css #buttons #inputs

We can style buttons using CSS.

`background-color` can change color.

`font-size` can change font size of button (and button size).

`padding` can add padding to influence width/height.

By default the size is determined by its text content.
But we can use `width` to override the width.

`border-radius` can give rounded corners or make it a circle.

`border` can give a colored border

`:hover` selector can change the style upon moving the mouse over it.
`transition-duration` can determine the speed of a hover effect.

`box-shadow` can add shadows to give some depth.
Nice when paired with `:hover`.

`opacity` can fade out and button and make it look disabled.
`cursor: not-allowed` shows a "no parking sign" over the cursor!

Removing margins and adding `float: left` can create a group of
buttons that border one another.
A `border` can look good on a button group.
`display: block` instead of `float: left` can make the group
stack vertically.
