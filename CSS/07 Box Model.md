# CSS Box Model
#css #box-model #margin #border #padding #content

From outermost to innermost parts of an element:
1. Margin: space outside of defined borders
2. Border
3. Padding: space inside defined borders, buffering content
4. Content: the good stuff (text, images, etc.)

`width` and `height` properties define the contents width and height.
The total width and height of an element is the sum of all widths and heights.
_excluding_ the margin.
The margin affects how much space the element takes up on the page though.
