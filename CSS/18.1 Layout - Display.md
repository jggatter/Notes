# CSS Layout: Display
#css #layout #display #inline #block #inline-block #width #max-width

The `display` property is the most important property for controlling layout.
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on the type of element.
The default for most elements is either `block` or `inline`.

## Block-level

Block-level elements **always** start on a new line
and take up the full width available.

Block-level elements include:
- `<div>`
- Headers, e.g. `<h1>`
- `<p>`
- `<form>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<section>`

## Inline elements

Inline elements do **not** start on a new line
and only take up as much width as necessary.

Examples include:
- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`

## `display` values

`display` has many values:
- `inline`: as inline element
- `block`: as block element
- `contents`: make container disappear, making child elements children of
the element next up in the DOM.
- `flex`: as block-level [[flex]]() container
- `grid`: as block-level [[grid]]() container
- `inline-block`: as inline-level block container; the element itself
is formatted as an inline element but height/width values can be applied.
- `inline-flex`: as inline-level flex container
- `inline-grid`: as inline-level grid container
- `inline-table` as inline-level table
- `run-in`: either as block or inline, depending on context
- `initial`: set to its initial value
- `inherit`: inherit from parent
- `none`: Completely hide the element

As opposed to `visibility:hidden`, `display:none` takes up no space.

There are also values that cause the element to be displayed like other elements:
- `list-item`: display like `<li>`
- `table`: display like `<table>`
And so on for `table-caption`, `table-column-group`, `table-header-group`,
`table-footer-group`, `table-row-group`, `table-cell`, `table-column`,
`table row`

The `display` value can be overridden.
A common example is for making horizontal menus:
```css
li {
  display: inline;
}
```

## In-line block

Compared to `inline`, the `inline-block`:
- allows us to set a width and height on the element.
- The top and bottom margins/padding are respected.

Compared to `block`, the `inline-block` does not add a line-break
after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

One common use for the value is to display list items horizontally
instead of vertically. Unlike the aforementioned example using `inline`,
it's blockier.

## Block-level: `max-width` with `margin:auto`

As mentioned in block-level element always takes up the full width available to it.
Setting `width` will prevent it, then `margin:auto` centers it horizontally
within its container.
The remaining space is split equally between the two margins.

If the screen is too small, like on a phone, then the div might not wrap properly
We can use the `max-width` instead of `width` to improve handling.
```css
div.example {
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```
