# CSS Layout: Overflow
#css #layout #overflow


`overflow` property controls what happens to content
that's too big to fit into an area.

`overflow` only works for block elements with a specified height.

It has the following values:
- `visible` (default): overflow is not clipped, content renders outside box
- `hidden`: overflow is clipped, the remaining content will be invisible
- `scroll`: overflow is clipped, a scrollbar is added to see the remainder
- `auto`: similar to `scroll` but adds scrollbars only when necessary

_Note: macOS seems to add scrollbars only when necessary._

## `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`

Specifies whether to change the overflow of content
just horizontally, or just vertically, or both.
```css
div {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

## `overflow-wrap`

Let the browser be allowed to break lines with long words if they overflow.

Values:
- `normal` (default): Disables
- `break-word`: Enables
- `anywhere`: Same thing?
