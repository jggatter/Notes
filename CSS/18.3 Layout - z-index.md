# CSS Layout: The z-index property
#css #layout #z-index #position

When elements are positioned, they can overlap with other elements.

The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element;
which element should be placed in front of or behind others.

Elements with a greater stack order always are in front of 
those with a lower stack order.

An element can have a positive or negative stack order.
```css
img {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0px;
  top: 0px;
  z-index: -1;
}
```
This image will be placed behind text with a `z-index` > -1.

The `z-index` only works on positioned elements (not `static`)
and flex items; direct children of `display: flex` elements.

If two positioned elements overlap each other without a `z-index` specified.
The element defined last in the HTML will be shown on top.
