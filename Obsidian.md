## Tags
Tag are a kind of link that make searches easier and allow connections between notes. 

Obsidian graph view allows visualization of these connections.

Example: `#obsidian` 

## Backlinks

Linked mention: `[[another note]]`

Unlinked mention: contain references to another note but no explicit link.

## New headers

As of October 2022, [document headers are now built-in](https://obsidian.rocks/obsidian-update-0-16-whats-new-and-how-to-use-it/#new-headers). Each note will have a header at the top of the document that corresponds to the name of the note. This feature is optional.

I don't know how to feel. I want lowercase filenames without spaces but I think I'll just live with it.
