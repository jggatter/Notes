Bind mounts are directories on the host filesystem that can be mounted onto containers. While they are more direct and transparent to the user, they are constrained by the host environment and can cause permission issues.

Named volumes in Docker exist as directories within Docker's filesystem on the host (i.e. under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). It's not recommended you interact directly with these directories as if they were normal directories, instead use the docker CLI, e.g. `docker cp`. Using them has benefits of easier management and portability across Docker environments.
