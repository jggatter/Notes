## Finder viewing hidden files

'Command' + 'Shift' + '.'

## Color picker

Digital Colormeter utility application can be used. A bit weird.

Otherwise most mac apps like Preview or TextEdit have them.
In Preview we can click on a Markup tool that allows color selection.
We click on "Show colors..." and go to Color Sliders.
We select the eye dropper and select a color on screen.
Under the color sliders the corresponding hex code should be displayed.
