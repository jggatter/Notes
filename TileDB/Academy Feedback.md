Order in which array concepts are explained is odd.
Array Model mainly details Dense and Sparse and has simple definitions for
dimensions, attributes, cells, etc.
Then Key Concepts details redundant info slightly more in depth.
Ex Attributes article begins exactly the same as Dimensions.

Dimension definition "hyperspace" is not beginner friendly and is unclear.
Hyperspace refers to >3D?

Logical and physical tiles still somewhat unclear to me.

Compression table has numpy options and types specified for all langs.
"Default Option is -1" what does this mean?

What is delta encoding?

For dense array indexing it would be good to:
explain the figure,
3, 4, 7, 8 are the same tile but are 3+4 a different slab from 7+8?
The definition of cell slab is not clear enough to me
It would be cool to discuss the scenario for col-major cell order.
Would this be 3 or 6 copy actions?
